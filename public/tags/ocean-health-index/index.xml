A significant portion of my work on the Ocean Health Index (OHI) involves working with raster data, a specific type of spatial data where values are held in grid cells. The data I work with varies from high resolution, remotely sensed data on sea surface temperature to coarse, modeled data on global fish catch. When I was working on the global assessment, I dealt with raster data at a global scale.</description>
