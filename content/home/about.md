# About Me

I am the coordinator for the [Master's of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) (MEDS) professional degree program at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. Prior to this role, I worked as a marine data scientist at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) (NCEAS) with Ben Halpern's lab group. My research portfolio was focused on assessing the health of our oceans and included conservation aquaculture and data-limited fisheries.

During my time at NCEAS I became an enthusiastic proponent of open, reproducible science and programming with R. Outside of my research, I enjoyed teaching my colleagues (and friends!) about the latest and greatest R tools to help with their work. This led to the founding of [EcoDataScience](http://eco-data-science.github.io/), an environmental data science study group at UCSB, and [RLadies Santa Barbara](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/). While I will always consider myself a marine scientist, my current focus is on community building and supporting the next generation of Environmental Data Scientists through MEDS.
